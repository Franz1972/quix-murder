 quix_murder_outcome.1001.d:0 "An opportunity arises. My agents have discovered [target.GetTitledFirstName] and entourage will be staying at an inn on an upcoming trip. This inn is made entirely from timber and has an old thatched roof. If we cannot easily get past [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] guards, they can just go up in the blaze as well.

 quix_murder_outcome.2001.no_awareness_1:0 "\n\nFortunately, buildings burn down all the time, and my involvement is not suspected."
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.no_awareness_2:0 "\n\nAny witnesses burned up with the inn!"
