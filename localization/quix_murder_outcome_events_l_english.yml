 #################

 # 1001 A Toasty Inn...
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.t:0 "A Toasty Inn..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.d:0 "An opportunity arises. My agents have discovered [target.GetTitledFirstName] and entourage will be staying at an inn on an upcoming trip. This inn is made entirely from timber and has an old thatched roof. If we cannot easily get past [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] guards, they can just go up in the blaze as well. The best part about the plan is it leaves no evidence.\n\nIt could even have been an accident..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.a:0 "Burn, baby, burn."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.b:0 "I happen to like that inn..."

  # 1002 Arrow to the Balcony Setup
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.t:0 "An Arrow to the Balcony..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.d:0 "In our efforts to rid the world of [target.GetTitledFirstName], a window of opportunity has appeared. Or, more fittingly, a balcony. It would appear that [target.GetTitledFirstName] has a favorite spot to take the most afternoons. This balcony is across a small courtyard from a tavern. Even a mediocre bowman could make the shot..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.a:0 "Send word for my best archer."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.b:0 "No, that's too dignified for[target.GetTitledFirstName]."

 #	1003 A Gift of Poisoned Wine Setup
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.t:0 "Dead Drunk."
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.d:0 "Tonight, while admiring a particularly fine bottle of wine, a thought occurred to me. Everyone knows that [target.GetName] is very fond of [target.GetHisorHers] cups. This vintage would make a fine present, and it could be recorked after the addition of some poision. Sent with a note of anonymous admiration...it just might work."
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.a:0 "Well, in that case, we shall drink this tonight and refill with swill. No sense in wasting the good stuff!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.b:0 "On second thought, I'll save it for a special occasion."

 #	1004 Night Terror
 quix_murder_outcome.1004.t:0 "Night Terrors"
 quix_murder_outcome.1004.d:0 "Our agents have come up with a plan to rid oursleves of [target.GetName]. It would appear they like to take long walks most evenings, completely alone. It's a prime opportunity to make them disappear into the darkness..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1004.a:0 "I will only regret they shall not see the look upon [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] face!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1004.b:0 "Perhaps it is too simple."

 #	1005 Stone Cold
 quix_murder_outcome.1005.t:0 "Stone Cold"
 quix_murder_outcome.1005.d:0 "[target.GetName] enjoys taking the air in a particular courtyard, beneath some particular walls. Our agents have found that one of the massive stones could be loosed from the old wall, sending it crashing upon [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] head!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1005.a:0 "Then allow this rock to roll!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1005.b:0 "This is wrong, [target.GetTitledFirstName] isn't worth the damaged masonry."

 #	1006 dereliction of duty
 quix_murder_outcome.1006.t:0 "Dereliction of Duty"
 quix_murder_outcome.1006.d:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] fate draws near! Our agents have an in to [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] own home. A servant, apparently offended by how they are treated by [target.GetTitledFirstName], has accepted a...small token of our appreciation, in exchange for allowing our an agent in at night! "
 quix_murder_outcome.1006.a:0 "Just make sure this servent doesn't talk."
 quix_murder_outcome.1006.b:0 "No, this could be a trap."

 #	1007 Daring Raid
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.t:0 "A Daring Raid"
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.d:0 "A bold plan to eliminate [target.GetName] is being discussed by my agents. It would appear there is a way into [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] quarters from the jakes, of all places. A few picked soldiers would swarm in, with veils on their faces, striking down any opposition, before dispatching [target.GetName] and fleeing into the night on horses staged nearby before the hue and cry can be raised."
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.a:0 "Fortune favors the bold!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.b:0 "This is foolhardy. Murder should be more...subtle."


 #	1008 Night Rider
 quix_murder_outcome.1008.t:0 "Night Rider"
 quix_murder_outcome.1008.d:0 "[target.GetName] is planning and small trip to a nearby town. The trip will take the better part of the day, and so [Target.Getname] will be arriving at their destination after nightfall. The roads are a dangerous place; a rider on a fresh horse could likely dispatch [Target.GetFirstName] and disappear into the night, any pursuers unable to keep up on tired mounts..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1008.a:0 "Well then, send my best rider upon my fastest horse!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1008.b:0 "No, this is to brazen a plan..."

 quix_murder_outcome.2002.owner_is_known_2:0 "\n\nAlthough the feat so impressed the bowman that he has been bragging that you paid him to kill [target.GetTitledFirstName]!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.no_awareness_1:0 "\n\nDespite the obvious assassination, it seems no one has caught on to me."
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.no_awareness_2:0 "\n\nAnd best of all, the bowman got away cleanly!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.a.discovered:0 "Me? Why would I want to kill [target.GetName]? I told him to shoot an old blind donkey, he misunderstood!"

 quix_murder_outcome.2003.owner_is_known_1:0 "\n\nThe bad news, however, is that the courier has implicated me!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.owner_is_known_2:0 "\n\nAlthough, in a terrible oversight, I seem to have signed my name to the letter with the bottle of wine..."
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.no_awareness_1:0 "\n\nAnd it would appear that nobody suspects a thing!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.no_awareness_2:0 "\n\nA drunkard dying while drunk is the ultimate disguise!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.a.discovered:0 "Oh my... that bottle of wine I had was poisoned? Good thing I didn't drink it!"

 quix_murder_outcome.2006.opening_2:0 "[target.GetName] caught their servant recieving money for letting the assassin in. Their dying breath was spent cursing the traitor rather than the assassin."
