 # 1000 - 1199 "REGULAR" MURDER SETUPS 
 #################

 # 1001 A Toasty Inn...
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.t:0 "A Toasty Inn..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.d:0 "An opportunity arises. My agents have discovered [target.GetTitledFirstName] and entourage will be staying at an inn on an upcoming trip. This inn is made entirely from timber and has an old thatched roof. If we cannot easily get past [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] guards, they can just go up in the blaze as well. The best part about the plan is it leaves no evidence.\n\nIt could even have been an accident..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.a:0 "Burn, baby, burn."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.b:0 "I happen to like that inn..."

  # 1002 Arrow to the Balcony Setup
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.t:0 "An Arrow to the Balcony..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.d:0 "In our efforts to rid the world of [target.GetTitledFirstName], a window of opportunity has appeared. Or, more fittingly, a balcony. It would appear that [target.GetTitledFirstName] has a favorite spot to take the most afternoons. This balcony is across a small courtyard from a tavern. Even a mediocre bowman could make the shot..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.a:0 "Send word for my best archer."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.b:0 "No, that's too dignified for[target.GetTitledFirstName]."

 #	1003 A Gift of Poisoned Wine Setup
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.t:0 "Dead Drunk."
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.d:0 "Tonight, while admiring a particularly fine bottle of wine, a thought occurred to me. Everyone knows that [target.GetName] is very fond of [target.GetHisorHers] cups. This vintage would make a fine present, and it could be recorked after the addition of some poision. Sent with a note of anonymous admiration...it just might work."
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.a:0 "Well, in that case, we shall drink this tonight and refill with swill. No sense in wasting the good stuff!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.b:0 "On second thought, I'll save it for a special occasion."

 ################# 
 # 2001 A Toasty Inn... Success
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.t:0 "A Toasty Inn..."
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.opening_1:0 "[target.GetName] went up in a towering inferno!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.opening_2:0 "Although not everything went to plan, the Arsonist was able to make due by barricading a few patrons inside with [target.GetName]. Wrong place, wrong time!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.opening_3:0 "The plan worked so well, the blaze took several other buildings along with the Inn. [target.GetName] Had no chance!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.heh:0 "\nHot."
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.owner_is_known_1:0 "\n\nHowever, it seems as if everyone has assumed it was my doing anyway!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.owner_is_known_2:0 "\n\nIt would seem that someone wasn't able to keep this a secret, however, and speculation abounds that I killed [target.GetTitledFirstName]."
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.no_awareness_1:0 "\n\nFortunately, buildings burn down all the time, and my involvement is not suspected."
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.no_awareness_2:0 "\n\nAny witnesses burned up with the inn!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.a.discovered:0 "But you are mistaken, he was merely an incompetent lamplighter!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2001.a:0 "From now on I believe I will sleep with a pale of water beside my bed..."
 # 2002 Arrow to the Balcony Success
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.t:0 "An Arrow to the Balcony."
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.opening_1:0 "I'm told the arrow caught [target.GetName] in the throat, and they died choking on their own blood."
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.opening_2:0 "It seems when my assassin hit [target.GetName], [target.GetHisorHer] body fell from that beloved balcony onto a maneur cart!."
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.owner_is_known_1:0 "\n\nUnfortunately, the bowman was apprehended and has accused me!!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.owner_is_known_2:0 "\n\nAlthough the feat so impressed the bowman that he has been bragging that you paid him to kill [target.GetTitledFirstName]!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.no_awareness_1:0 "\n\nDespite the obvious assassination, it seems no one has caught on to me."
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.no_awareness_2:0 "\n\nAnd best of all, the bowman got away cleanly!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.a.discovered:0 "Me? Why would I want to kill [target.GetName]? I told him to shoot an old blind donkey, he misunderstood!"
 # 2003 Dead Drunk Success
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.t:0 "Dead Drunk."
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.opening_1:0 "[target.GetName] died in [target.GetHisorHer] sleep last night."
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.opening_2:0 "Word is that a drunken [target.GetName] had a psychotic break, cursing family and blaspheming for hours, until [target.GetHeOrShe] died coughing up blood and raving."
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.owner_is_known_1:0 "\n\nThe bad news, however, is that the courier has implicated me!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.owner_is_known_2:0 "\n\nAlthough, in a terrible oversight, I seem to have signed my name to the letter with the bottle of wine..."
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.no_awareness_1:0 "\n\nAnd it would appear that nobody suspects a thing!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.no_awareness_2:0 "\n\nA drunkard dying while drunk is the ultimate disguise!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2003.a.discovered:0 "Oh my... that bottle of wine I had was poisoned? Good thing I didn't drink it!"
