 # 1000 - 1199 "REGULAR" MURDER SETUPS 
 #################

 # 1001 A Toasty Inn...
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.t:0 "A Toasty Inn..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.d:0 "An opportunity arises. My agents have discovered [target.GetTitledFirstName] and entourage will be staying at an inn on an upcoming trip. This inn is made entirely from timber and has an old thatched roof. If we cannot easily get past [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] guards, they can just go up in the blaze as well. The best part about the plan is it leaves no evidence.\n\nIt could even have been an accident..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.a:0 "Burn, baby, burn."
 quix_murder_outcome.1001.b:0 "I happen to like that inn..."

  # 1002 Arrow to the Balcony Setup
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.t:0 "An Arrow to the Balcony..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.d:0 "In our efforts to rid the world of [target.GetTitledFirstName], a window of opportunity has appeared. Or, more fittingly, a balcony. It would appear that [target.GetTitledFirstName] has a favorite spot to take the most afternoons. This balcony is across a small courtyard from a tavern. Even a mediocre bowman could make the shot..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.a:0 "Send word for my best archer."
 quix_murder_outcome.1002.b:0 "No, that's too dignified for[target.GetTitledFirstName]."

 #	1003 A Gift of Poisoned Wine Setup
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.t:0 "Dead Drunk."
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.d:0 "Tonight, while admiring a particularly fine bottle of wine, a thought occurred to me. Everyone knows that [target.GetName] is very fond of [target.GetHisorHers] cups. This vintage would make a fine present, and it could be recorked after the addition of some poision. Sent with a note of anonymous admiration...it just might work."
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.a:0 "Well, in that case, we shall drink this tonight and refill with swill. No sense in wasting the good stuff!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1003.b:0 "On second thought, I'll save it for a special occasion."

 #	1004 Night Terror
 quix_murder_outcome.1004.t:0 "Night Terrors"
 quix_murder_outcome.1004.d:0 "Our agents have come up with a plan to rid oursleves of [target.GetName]. It would appear they like to take long walks most evenings, completely alone. It's a prime opportunity to make them disappear into the darkness..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1004.a:0 "I will only regret they shall not see the look upon [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] face!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1004.b:0 "Perhaps it is too simple."

 #	1005 Stone Cold
 quix_murder_outcome.1005.t:0 "Stone Cold"
 quix_murder_outcome.1005.d:0 "[target.GetName] enjoys taking the air in a particular courtyard, beneath some particular walls. Our agents have found that one of the massive stones could be loosed from the old wall, sending it crashing upon [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] head!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1005.a:0 "Then allow this rock to roll!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1005.b:0 "This is wrong, [target.GetTitledFirstName] isn't worth the damaged masonry."

 #	1006 dereliction of duty
 quix_murder_outcome.1006.t:0 "Dereliction of Duty"
 quix_murder_outcome.1006.d:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] fate draws near! Our agents have an in to [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] own home. A servant, apparently offended by how they are treated by [target.GetTitledFirstName], has accepted a...small token of our appreciation, in exchange for allowing our an agent in at night! "
 quix_murder_outcome.1006.a:0 "Just make sure this servent doesn't talk."
 quix_murder_outcome.1006.b:0 "No, this could be a trap."

 #	1007 Daring Raid
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.t:0 "A Daring Raid"
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.d:0 "A bold plan to eliminate [target.GetName] is being discussed by my agents. It would appear there is a way into [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] quarters from the jakes, of all places. A few picked soldiers would swarm in, with veils on their faces, striking down any opposition, before dispatching [target.GetName] and fleeing into the night on horses staged nearby before the hue and cry can be raised."
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.a:0 "Fortune favors the bold!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.b:0 "This is foolhardy. Murder should be more...subtle."

 #	1008 Night Rider
 quix_murder_outcome.1008.t:0 "Night Rider"
 quix_murder_outcome.1008.d:0 "[target.GetName] is planning and small trip to a nearby town. The trip will take the better part of the day, and so [Target.Getname] will be arriving at their destination after nightfall. The roads are a dangerous place; a rider on a fresh horse could likely dispatch [Target.GetFirstName] and disappear into the night, any pursuers unable to keep up on tired mounts..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1008.a:0 "Well then, send my best rider upon my fastest horse!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1008.b:0 "No, this is to brazen a plan..."

 #	1009 The Bold bloodletter
 quix_murder_outcome.1009.t:0 "The Bold Bloodletter"
 quix_murder_outcome.1009.d:0 "Lately, a healer has caused quite a stir with his supposed knowledge of physic. He claims that, by bleeding his patients, he can cure them of all ills.
Our agents have learned that [target.GetName] has attempted to contact this healer, and have intercepted this communication. We could send an imposter and  [target.GetTitledFirstName] would gladly open their veins for us!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1009.a:0 "When I decided I wanted [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] blood , I had no idea it would be this easy..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1009.b:0 "No, the risk we accidentally cure [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] ailment is too great."

 #	1010 Masqued Murderers
 quix_murder_outcome.1010.t:0 "Masqued Murderers"
 quix_murder_outcome.1010.d:0 "Our agents have learned that [target.GetTitledFirst] will be attending social event where everyone will be wearing masks! It would be easy enough for our men to slip in unnoticed and then blend into the crowd."
 quix_murder_outcome.1010.a:0 "How thoughtful of [target.GetTitledFirstName]! May as well send a whole band of men!"
 quix_murder_outcome.10.b:0 "It sounds like a trap. Too easy."

#	1011 The Foreign Warrior (foreign_warrior)
 quix_murder_outcome.1011.t:0 "The Foreign Warrior"
 quix_murder_outcome.1011.d:0 "Our agents have been in contact with a warrior from a foreign land. His methods and ways are strange, but he is purpotedly as fierce with his strange blade as he is stealthy. Perhaps we could employ them to help [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] along their way..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1011.a:0 "All the better to hire someone with no connections or interests here..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1011.b:0 "This task is far too important to trust to some strange man."

#	1012 Cry Havoc (dog_attack)
 quix_murder_outcome.1012.t:0 "Cry Havoc!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1012.d:0 "[target.GetName] seems to enjoy walks alone in the wilderness, where wild beasts are abound. It's quite dangerous, so perhaps we should send a trainer and some war dogs to...protect them. We certainly wouldn't want them to be mauled to death."
 quix_murder_outcome.1012.a:0 "Pick the biggest ones, and... Make sure they're hungry."
 quix_murder_outcome.1012.b:0 "No. I can't trust a beast to do a human's job."

#	1013 A pool of blood (bath_house)
 quix_murder_outcome.1013.t:0 "A Pool of Blood"
 quix_murder_outcome.1013.d:0 "We've learned [target.GetName] visits local healing pools every week, for a seculded bath. Naked, defenseless, and alone sounds like the perfect recipe for a successful assassination..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1013.a:0 "I do enjoy the irony of dying in a healing pool..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1013.b:0 "I have a bad feeling about this."

#	1014 A Chance Encounter... (pushed_off_ledge)
 quix_murder_outcome.1014.t:0 "A Chance Encounter"
 quix_murder_outcome.1014.d:0 "On a leisurely trip away from my domain, I was taking a pleasant stroll a river, and who do I see, but none other than [target.GetName] standing by a bluff over the rushing water. The flow of the river is very strong today, it's doubtful anybody would ever be able to make it out..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1014.a:0 "Perhaps we should go help [target.GetTitledFirstName] on their way..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1014.b:0 "As tempting as it is, I should not get my hands dirty. Or wet, for that matter."

#	1015 Broad Daylight (market_murder)
 quix_murder_outcome.1015.t:0 "In Broad Daylight"
 quix_murder_outcome.1015.d:0 "Enough waiting. I want [target.GetTitledFirstName] dead. If we cannot find some clever way to dispatch them, then perhaps we should do it the old fashioned way. We'll send men with full helmets, who will simply cut them down at the first opportunity. It doesn't get any simpler than that."
 quix_murder_outcome.1015.a:0 "Yes, I've grown impatient over [Target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] continued existence. Send them now."
 quix_murder_outcome.1015.b:0 "No, no. We must devise a better plan."

#	1016 Catch and Decease (captive_kill)
 quix_murder_outcome.1016.t:0 "Catch and Decease"
 quix_murder_outcome.1016.d:0 "A plan has been formed by our agents to finally kill [target.GetTitledFirstName]. The plan is to catch [target.GetName] in the street and then taken them into custody, attempting to make it seem official to onlookers. After apprehending [target.GetTitledFirstName], we bring them here, and we can lop off their head as we please."
 quix_murder_outcome.1016.a:0 "It sounds like a solid plan."
 quix_murder_outcome.1016.b:0 "It sounds like a terrible plan."

#	1017 Poisoned Dart (poison_dart)
 quix_murder_outcome.1017.t:0 "A Poisoned Dart"
 quix_murder_outcome.1017.d:0 "Our agents have acquired a novel weapon. It is a small reed that allows a small poisoned art to be launched at quite remarkable distances towards a target, and can deliver a fatal dose of poison. Perhaps this could be the method by which we dispatch [Target.Getname]?"
 quix_murder_outcome.1017.a:0 "What a marvelous tool."
 quix_murder_outcome.1017.b:0 "I won't trust something this important to a mere hollow stick!"

#	0118 Do It Yourself (diy_murder)
 quix_murder_outcome.1018.t:0 "Do It Yourself"
 quix_murder_outcome.1018.d:0 "I have grown sick of hearing my agents bicker over bad plans to kill [target.GetName]. If I want this done right, I'm going to have to do it myself. We know where [target.GetTitledFirstName] sleeps. I'll let myself in through a window, slip into the bedroom, and be done with it."
 quix_murder_outcome.1018.a:0 "Now where is my cowl..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1018.b:0 "On second thought, the weather just isn't right for this. Back to the infernal drawing board."

#	0119 The Prize Fighter (hired_brawler)
 quix_murder_outcome.1019.t:0 "The Prize Fighter"
 quix_murder_outcome.1019.d:0 "A foreign peasant, famous in their land as a pit fighter, has arrived in my realm seeking employ. His tognue was cut out long ago, and even then, he can't speak the language to begin with. He is built like a bear, and may just be the perfect one to deal with [target.GetTitledFirstName]."
 quix_murder_outcome.1019.a:0 "He sounds lovely!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1019.b:0 "This is not the calibur of professional I have come to expect."

#	0120 A Shadowy Organization (assassins_guild)
 quix_murder_outcome.1020.t:0 "A Shadowy Organization..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1020.d:0 "Our agents have made contact with some people who say they can help with our [target.GetTitledFirstName] problem. Unfortunately we don’t know anything about this group, they are very secretive. But they do come with a glowing recommendation for efficiency and professionalism..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1020.a:0 "How Very Mysterious. I am Intrigued."
 quix_murder_outcome.1020.b:0 "Another word for Shadowy is Shady. I’ll pass."

 quix_murder_outcome.2001.no_awareness_2:0 "\n\nAny witnesses burned up with the inn!"

 quix_murder_outcome.2002.owner_is_known_1:0 "\n\nUnfortunately, the bowman was apprehended and has accused me!!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.owner_is_known_2:0 "\n\nAlthough the feat so impressed the bowman that he has been bragging that I paid him to kill [target.GetTitledFirstName]!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.no_awareness_1:0 "\n\nDespite the obvious assassination, it seems no one has caught on to me."
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.no_awareness_2:0 "\n\nAnd best of all, the bowman got away cleanly!"
 quix_murder_outcome.2002.a.discovered:0 "Me? Why would I want to kill [target.GetName]? I told him to shoot an old blind donkey, he misunderstood!"

 quix_murder_outcome.2004.owner_is_known_1:0 "\n\nIn a cruel twist of fate, just a few feet from the attack was a guard in the shadows, my involvement is known!"
