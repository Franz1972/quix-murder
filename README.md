# Quixotic Murder - Crusader Kings 3 Mod
**Version: Alpha 1**

*by El Ingenioso Hidalgo y Caballero Don Quixote de la Mancha ~ https://DonQuixote.Games/*

Events mod for Crusader Kings 3 by Paradox Interactive. Will add dozens of new murder events focused on immersion, roleplaying, and flavor, while not affecting overall game tone or balance.

Still in very early access. Will be posted to steam workshop when it's done tm.

## Compatibility
This mod is NOT compatible with other murder scheme event mods. Technically speaking, I am overwriting murder_on_actions.txt because this is the only way I can figure out to insert the custom events into schemes. If you know a better way, please let me know. Mod authors, I would be happy to release a patch for your mod and give you everything you need to release one for mine, hit me up.

## Installation
Put in your CK3 Mods Folder (Documents\Paradox)

## Fine Print
Cruasder Kings 3 is property of Paradox Interactive. Mod is made in compliance with Paradox Interactive Mod Policy.

Feel free to modify this mod. If you want to distribute your fork, all I ask is please don't use the "Quixotic" name in the title, but do give attribution to me (Don Quixote) in the description. Link to my site https://DonQuixote.Games/ for maximum honor gain.
