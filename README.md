# Quixotic Murder - Crusader Kings 3 Mod
**Version: 1.3.001**
*by El Ingenioso Hidalgo y Caballero Don Quixote de la Mancha ~ https://DonQuixote.Games/*

**Adds 20 NEW Murder Scheme Outcome Event Chains**

Tired of killing people the same few ways for HUNDREDS OF YEARS!?

This mod is intended to greatly enhance the variety of murder schemes in the game. In vanilla, there are only 7 standard murder scheme outcomes. This mod nearly triples that, adding 20 new events in addition to the vanilla events. It was designed with an attempt to keep the tone and writing style close to vanilla, while not affecting game balance at all. It is intended for roleplay, flavor, and immersion. I hope you enjoy it!

Your Humble Servant,
Don Quixote de la Mancha

## Language Support
All Quixotic mods are only officially supported in English Only. Any languages provided are community translations and I cannot personally verify the quality, the accuracy, or the content of these translations. Furthmore, as I continue to update and expand these mods, some language files will become outdated and may have missing localizations for newer events.

## Compatibility
This mod is NOT compatible with other murder scheme event mods. Technically speaking, I am overwriting murder_on_actions.txt because this is the only way I can figure out to insert the custom events into schemes. If you know a better way, please let me know. Mod authors, I would be happy to release a patch for your mod and give you everything you need to release one for mine, hit me up. If you want it to load Quixotic Murder events into another mod, like a total conversion, run it lower in the load order.

Beyond murder scheme mods, this mod should be fully compatible with just about everything. If the mod doesn't contain murder_on_actions.txt - it's fully compatible!

## Installation
Put in your CK3 Mods Folder. Usually this is:
C:\users\\%username%\documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod

If you install the mod manually, be sure to delete any previous versions rather than overwriting (as some files are subject to removal).

Eventually:

* New Spy Role - Hire spies to help your plots and foil your rivals!

* New Role Based Interactions & Decisions (Search for/Hire/Dismiss)
* New Roles Based Murder Scheme outcomes, saves, and random events

More scheme event mods for schemes other than murder coming soon, eventually extending to all schemes! Stay tuned, my friends.

## Content Warning
This is a murder mod, and, as such, you will not be surprised to learn it contains depictions of violence and murder, with an occasionally flippant take on these subjects.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to:
* Dulcinea, her most serene beauty, for always being my creative muse.
* My most noble squire, Sancho Panza.

I would also ask a personal favor that you do not use the name Quixotic in the title just to not confuse people as I will hopefully be publishing many more mods under this moniker.
