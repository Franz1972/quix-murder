# Quixotic Murder - Crusader Kings 3 Mod
**Version: Alpha 2**
NOT FULLY WORKING YET.

*by El Ingenioso Hidalgo y Caballero Don Quixote de la Mancha ~ https://DonQuixote.Games/*

**Adds 20 NEW Murder Scheme Outcome Event Chains**

Tired of killing people the same few ways for HUNDREDS OF YEARS!?

This mod is intended to greatly enhance the variety of murder schemes in the game. In vanilla, there are only 7 standard murder scheme outcomes. This mod nearly triples that, adding 20 new events in addition to the vanilla events. It was designed with an attempt to keep the tone and writing style close to vanilla, while not affecting game balance at all. It is intended for roleplay and immersion. I hope you enjoy it!

Your Humble Servant,
Don Quixote de la Mancha

## Compatibility
This mod is NOT compatible with other murder scheme event mods. Technically speaking, I am overwriting murder_on_actions.txt because this is the only way I can figure out to insert the custom events into schemes. If you know a better way, please let me know. Mod authors, I would be happy to release a patch for your mod and give you everything you need to release one for mine, hit me up. If you want it to load Quixotic Murder events into another mod, like a total conversion, run it lower in the load order.

Beyond murder scheme mods, this mod should be fully compatible with just about everything. If the mod doesn't contain murder_on_actions.txt - it's fully compatible!

## Installation
Put in your CK3 Mods Folder. Usually this is:
C:\users\\%username%\documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod

If you install the mod manually, be sure to delete any previous versions rather than overwriting (as some files are subject to removal).

## Mod Content
Additions:
* 20 new regular murder scheme outcome event chains (60 individual events!)

## Roadmap
Near Future:
* 10+ New murder saves
* 10+ New murder maintenance events
* 10+ New Child & Prisoner murder outcomes
* 10+ New random character interaction events
* 10+ Post-murder event chains

Eventually:
* Lots of conditional murder outcomes and saves based on era/culture/religion/war status/historical bookmarks etc - this will be the goal after all "generic" style events are complete.
* New Assassin Role - Hire your own personal assassin to hunt your enemeis to the edge of diplomatic range!
* New Bodyguard Role - Hire a trusted bodyguard to protect you from assassins!
* New Spy Role - Hire spies to help your plots and foil your rivals!
* New Poisoner role - Craft devious poisions to help in your murder schemes!
* New Food Taster role - The only way to make sure its safe is to have someone *else* eat it!
* New Role Based Interactions & Decisions (Search for/Hire/Dismiss)
* New Roles Based Murder Scheme outcomes, saves, and random events

More scheme event mods for schemes other than murder coming soon, eventually extending to all schemes! Stay tuned, my friends.

## Content Warning
This is a murder mod, and, as such, you will not be surprised to learn it contains depictions of violence and murder, with an occasionally flippant take on these subjects.
