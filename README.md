# Quixotic Murder - Crusader Kings 3 Mod
**Version: Alpha 1**

*by El Ingenioso Hidalgo y Caballero Don Quixote de la Mancha ~ https://DonQuixote.Games/*

Events mod for Crusader Kings 3 by Paradox Interactive. Will add dozens of new murder events focused on immersion, roleplaying, and flavor, while not affecting overall game tone or balance.

Still in very early access. Will be posted to steam workshop when it's done tm.

## Compatibility
This mod is NOT compatible with other murder scheme event mods. Technically speaking, I am overwriting murder_on_actions.txt because this is the only way I can figure out to insert the custom events into schemes. If you know a better way, please let me know. Mod authors, I would be happy to release a patch for your mod and give you everything you need to release one for mine, hit me up.

If you want it to load Quixotic Murder events into another mod, like a total conversion, run it lower in the load order.

## Installation
Put in your CK3 Mods Folder. Usually this is:
C:\users\%username%\documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod

If you install the mod manually, be sure to delete any previous versions.

## Content Warning
This is a murder mod, and, as such, you will not be surprised to learn it contains depictions of violence and murder, with an occasionally flippant take on these subjects.
